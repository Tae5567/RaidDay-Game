# Raid Day - Boss Battle Arena

**A collaborative boss battle game for Reddit communities built with Phaser.js**

Raid Day is a 2D boss battle game that brings Reddit communities together to defeat daily themed bosses. Built with Phaser.js 3.70+ and integrated with Reddit's Devvit platform, the game features streamlined combat mechanics, character class selection, and community-driven boss battles with shared HP pools.

## What is Raid Day?

Raid Day is a community-driven boss battle game where Reddit users work together to defeat daily themed bosses. Each day features a different boss representing internet culture - from "The Lag Spike" (Gaming) to "The Algorithm" (Internet) to "The Cringe" (Memes) - with 50,000 HP that's shared across all players.

The game features streamlined combat where players select a character class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer) and engage in battles against the daily boss. Combat uses a dual health system where players have 500 HP while fighting against bosses with 50,000 shared HP. Players attack by clicking the attack button, triggering satisfying 0.8-second animation sequences, while bosses retaliate every 8-15 seconds.

**Current Implementation**: The game is fully functional with a complete 7-scene system (Boot ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí CharacterSelect ‚Üí HowToPlay ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Victory). It features responsive full-screen scaling that adapts to any device size, character class selection with balanced gameplay, click-to-attack combat mechanics with visual feedback, and Reddit integration for sharing battle results. The game uses automatically generated placeholder graphics while maintaining complete functionality.

## What Makes Raid Day Innovative and Unique

‚ö° **Simple Click-to-Attack Combat**: Raid Day features intuitive one-button combat where players click the "ATTACK" button to deal damage. Each attack triggers a 0.8-second animation sequence where your character runs forward, attacks the boss, and returns to position. The system provides immediate visual feedback with screen shake, floating damage numbers, and boss hit reactions.

üéØ **Balanced Character Classes**: Choose from 4 character classes - Warrior (balanced), Mage (high damage), Rogue (critical hits), and Healer (support) - each with unique sprites and abilities. All classes deal similar damage ranges (160-240) to ensure balanced gameplay where strategy matters more than class selection.

üéÆ **Dual Health System**: Experience battles where both you and the boss have health bars:
- **Your Health**: 500 HP that decreases when the boss attacks every 8-15 seconds
- **Boss Health**: 50,000 HP shared across the community
- **Strategic Combat**: Balance offense and survival as you race to deal damage before the boss defeats you
- **Session-Based**: Each battle continues until your HP reaches 0 or the boss is defeated

‚öîÔ∏è **Visual Combat Feedback**: The game features satisfying visual effects:
- **Attack Animations**: 0.8-second sequences where characters run forward, attack, and return
- **Screen Shake**: Dynamic camera effects scaled by damage (normal, critical, boss phase)
- **Damage Numbers**: Floating damage indicators with "YOUR damage: +234" styling
- **Boss Reactions**: Hit flashes, knockback effects, and visual feedback

üóìÔ∏è **Daily Boss Rotation**: Seven themed bosses representing internet culture:
