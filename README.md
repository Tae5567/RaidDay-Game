# Raid Day - Boss Battle Arena

**A collaborative boss battle game for Reddit communities built with Phaser.js**

Raid Day is a 2D boss battle game that brings Reddit communities together to defeat daily themed bosses. Built with Phaser.js 3.70+ and integrated with Reddit's Devvit platform, the game features streamlined combat mechanics, character class selection, and community-driven boss battles with shared HP pools.

## What is Raid Day?

Raid Day is a community-driven boss battle game where Reddit users work together to defeat daily themed bosses. Each day features a different boss representing internet culture - from "The Lag Spike" (Gaming) to "The Algorithm" (Internet) to "The Cringe" (Memes) - with 50,000 HP that's shared across all players.

The game features streamlined combat where players select a character class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer) and engage in 60-second battle sessions against the daily boss. Combat uses a dual health system where players have 500 HP while fighting against bosses with 50,000 shared HP. Players attack by clicking the attack button, triggering satisfying 0.8-second animation sequences, while bosses retaliate every 8-15 seconds dealing 50-150 damage.

**Current Implementation**: The game is fully functional with a complete 7-scene system (Boot ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí CharacterSelect ‚Üí HowToPlay ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Victory). It features responsive full-screen scaling that adapts to any device size, character class selection with balanced gameplay, click-to-attack combat mechanics with visual feedback, physics-based victory celebrations, and Reddit integration for sharing battle results.

## What Makes Raid Day Innovative and Unique

‚ö° **Simple Click-to-Attack Combat**: Raid Day features intuitive one-button combat where players click the "ATTACK" button to deal damage. Each attack triggers a precise 0.8-second animation sequence where your character runs forward (0.3s), attacks the boss (0.2s), and returns to position (0.3s). The system provides immediate visual feedback with screen shake, floating damage numbers, and boss hit reactions.

üéØ **Balanced Character Classes**: Choose from 4 character classes with unique critical hit chances:
- **Warrior**: Balanced damage (180-220) with 15% critical hit chance - reliable and consistent
- **Mage**: High magical damage (200-250) with 10% critical hit chance - high damage output
- **Rogue**: Variable damage (160-200) with 30% critical hit chance - high-risk/high-reward gameplay
