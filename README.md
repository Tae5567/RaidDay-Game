# Raid Day - Boss Battle Arena

**A fast-paced collaborative boss battle game for Reddit built with Phaser.js**

Raid Day is a fully playable 2D boss battle game designed to bring Reddit communities together in intense, time-limited boss fights. Built with Phaser.js 3.70+ and integrated with Reddit's Devvit platform, this streamlined game features rapid combat sessions with simple click-to-attack mechanics and community sharing.

## What is Raid Day?

Raid Day is an action-packed browser-based boss battle game that delivers quick, engaging combat sessions perfect for Reddit's fast-paced environment. The game features a revolutionary session-based combat system where players engage in focused 2-minute battle sessions against daily rotating bosses themed around internet culture - from "The Lag Spike" (Gaming) to "The Algorithm" (Internet) to "The Cringe" (Memes).

The game combines streamlined mechanics with engaging gameplay through simplified attack mechanics and session management. Players can unleash up to 10 attacks per 2-minute session with simple click-to-attack gameplay, featuring dynamic visual effects and immediate feedback for every action.

**Current Implementation**: The game is fully playable with a complete 5-scene progression system (Boot ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Victory), featuring the SessionSystem for structured 2-minute combat sessions with 10-attack limits, simplified click-to-attack mechanics with 0.8-second attack cooldowns, comprehensive visual effects including dynamic screen shake and floating damage numbers, and session-based gameplay with Reddit sharing integration. The game uses FIT scaling mode to maintain aspect ratio while filling the screen, providing an optimized boss battle experience that adapts to any device size (320x240 to 1920x1080) with mobile-first responsive design. All game systems work with automatically generated placeholder graphics, providing the complete boss battle experience while being ready for custom sprite integration.

The latest update includes enhanced victory celebrations with spectacular boss death sequences featuring multiple explosion phases, enhanced screen effects with boss-themed color flashes, physics-based loot rain with different item types, and comprehensive Reddit integration for sharing victory achievements with the community.
