# Raid Day - Boss Battle Arena

**A fast-paced collaborative boss battle game for Reddit built with Phaser.js**

Raid Day is a fully playable 2D boss battle game designed to bring Reddit communities together in intense, time-limited boss fights. Built with Phaser.js 3.70+ and integrated with Reddit's Devvit platform, this streamlined game features rapid combat sessions with simple click-to-attack mechanics and community sharing.

## What is Raid Day?

Raid Day is an action-packed browser-based boss battle game that delivers quick, engaging combat sessions perfect for Reddit's fast-paced environment. The game features a revolutionary combat system where players engage in focused battles against daily rotating bosses themed around internet culture - from "The Lag Spike" (Gaming) to "The Algorithm" (Internet) to "The Cringe" (Memes).

The game combines streamlined mechanics with engaging gameplay through simplified attack mechanics and responsive design. Players can attack bosses with simple click-to-attack gameplay, featuring dynamic visual effects and immediate feedback for every action, while their character automatically runs forward, attacks, and returns in satisfying 0.8-second sequences.

**Current Implementation**: The game is fully playable with a complete 7-scene progression system (Boot ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí CharacterSelect ‚Üí HowToPlay ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Victory), featuring simplified click-to-attack mechanics with 0.8-second attack cooldowns, comprehensive visual effects including dynamic screen shake and floating damage numbers, character class selection with 4 unique classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Healer), and session-based gameplay with Reddit sharing integration. The game uses responsive RESIZE scaling to fill the entire screen, providing an optimized boss battle experience that adapts to any device size (320x240 to 2560x1440) with mobile-first responsive design. All game systems work with automatically generated placeholder graphics, providing the complete boss battle experience while being ready for custom sprite integration.

The game includes enhanced victory celebrations with spectacular boss death sequences featuring multiple explosion phases, enhanced screen effects with boss-themed color flashes, physics-based loot rain with different item types, comprehensive Reddit integration for sharing victory achievements with the community, and a live leaderboard system showing real-time player rankings with enhanced styling for the current user.

## What Makes Raid Day Innovative and Unique

‚ö° **Streamlined Click-to-Attack Combat**: Unlike complex RPGs, Raid Day features intuitive one-button combat where players simply click the large "ATTACK" button to deal damage to the boss. Each attack triggers a satisfying 0.8-second animation sequence where your character runs forward, attacks, and returns to position. The system provides immediate visual feedback with screen shake, floating damage numbers, and boss hit reactions, making every attack feel impactful and responsive.

üéØ **Character Class System with Balanced Gameplay**: Choose from 4 distinct character classes - Warrior (balanced high damage), Mage (very high magical damage), Rogue (30% critical hit chance), and Healer (support abilities) - each with unique visual styles and special abilities. Despite class differences, all characters deal similar damage ranges (160-240) to ensure balanced gameplay where skill and timing matter more than class selection.

üéÆ **Dual Combat System - Player vs Boss**: Experience intense 1v1 battles where both you and the boss have health bars:
- **Your Health**: 500 HP that decreases when the boss attacks you every 8-15 seconds
- **Boss Health**: 50,000 HP shared across the community that persists between sessions
- **Strategic Timing**: Balance offense and survival as you race to deal damage before the boss defeats you
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch your character animate forward for each attack while monitoring both health bars
